# JavaScript Web
As a veteran software engineer, I have architected and developed a number of software management systems using Java/JavaScript. I have been the interviewer and interviewee for many frontend developer positions. I published [ACE Your Java Interview](https://www.amazon.com/ACE-Your-Java-Interview-Jennifer/dp/1484104935/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1566344263&sr=1-9) a few years ago, which is still a best-seller today.

My fellow developers ask me when I am going to publish an interview reference book for JavaScript. I have been working on it for a while. The content keeps changing along with the evolving ECMAScript standards, as well as emerging frameworks and libraries. It becomes a never-ending project.

For years, I have been nourished by a lot of open source materials. I have read many articles, and some of them become my favorites. Why don’t I link them in a centralized location to make a JavaScript Web for easy access? It is no longer a conventional book. It is composed by many people’s work, and it is a resource for frontend job interview and daily development work.

This provides a number of advantages: 

*	It allows constantly adding and updating content.
*	It speeds up the writing process.
*	It gets on-going feedback.
